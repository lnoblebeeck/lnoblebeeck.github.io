So the main reason for me starting this data sign course was as a result of a number of different reasons that include: family members taking a similar course, my current job, my future job interests and the time I have available.

I was first introduced to a somewhat attenuated for of datascience through my studies in mechanical engineering. However, this was, in general working with very targetted data that was almost always first party (so sorted and organized by myself before manipulating) and never more then 500 lines. Furthermore, all the data manipulation happened almost exclusivey in MatLab, which while useful for engineering is not necesarrily trasferable when wanting to pursue a career outside of that space.  As such, I had never given too much thought to it. 

It wasn't until I started my new job as an analyst at a digital media adevertising firm that I really began to feel the need to expand my day to day analytics skills outside of  excel. I kept running into the same issues of files that were too long to process, the horrors of recieving data extraction over 50000 lines long that werent formatted correctly, crashing excel over and over again trying to do simple math operations, etc. As a reesult i started to look for new ways that I coul process big data. Having a cousin that had completed a similar course at a different institution, I reached out to him to find out what his experience was like. As I kept speaking with him and others at work, I found myself more and more interested in the possibilities that came with being able to code properly and manipulate these large data sets. After some digging, I found the flat iron school, had a bunch of very interesting conversations with different people and now here I am, excited to keep learning!
